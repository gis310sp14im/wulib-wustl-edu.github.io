### Agile Development & Project Management:
---

    - Iterative approach to project management and software development
    - Deliver work in short 2-4 week cycles
    - Requirements turned into user stories ("I need to be able to submit a form")


__Software possibilities__: Atlassian Suite (Jira, Bitbucket, Trello) or Gitlab

#### Scrum Framework:
---

Roles:

    - Scrum Master (champions/keeps scrum method going on team)
    - Product Owner (voice of the product...super user of product)
    - Scrum Team (all of us grunts that do the work)

Key Features:

    - Scrum Board: visualize all the work in a sprint
    - Product Backlog: prioritized list of features to be implemented
    - Sprint Backlog: items from product backlog (issues/items to be worked on) during that sprint cycle

Four Events of Scrum (framework for agile project management and development):

   1. Sprint Plan (what to complete in the 2 to 4 week cycle)
   2. Sprint Demo (team shares what is going to ship in the sprint)
   3. Daily Standup (10-15 minute meeting where people share what they are working on that day and problems faced)
   4. Retrospective (review of what went well and badly in the last 2 to 4 week cycle)

#### Kanban Framework:
---

Key Features:

    - To Do, In Progress, Done Columns
    - No Backlogs (like in Scrum), Work is in To Do Column
    - Team handles what they can based on capacity and [WIP Limits](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits)
    - Visualized on Board


Four Components of Kanban:

  1. List of work (user stories) that need to get done
  2. Columns/Lanes: distinguish tasks between different projects, work types, etc.
  3. WIP (Work in Progress Limits): limit the amount of work to be done based on team's capacity
  4. Continuous Releases: team works on the amount allowed in WIP limit and releases anytime they are ready
