## Basic Cycle

1. Develop
2. Test
3. Provision
4. Configure
5. Deploy
6. Monitor
7. Feedback


Components:

    -  Continuous Integration (develop, test/build)
    -  Cloud Provision (setup environment for app)
    -  Configuration Management (configure environment for app)
    -  Continuous Delivery/Deployment (deploy app to dev, staging, production servers)
    -  Continous Monitoring (keep eye on whole cycle) >>> Continuous Feedback (gather input from users, from system, from product owner to make improvements and fix bugs)

## Gitlab for DevOps:

__NOTE__: Please note this is not a waterfall approach. This is an iterative process that occurs for each project. The below are guidelines and tools that

![Gitlab Cycle](https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/idea-to-production-10-steps.png "Test")

Stages of Software Developments:

1. Idea: every new proposal/project that comes to the LTS group should be submitted as a proposal following guidelines established by LTS team and Library Leadership
2. Issue: the above idea should be submitted as an issue via the Gitlab Issue Boards for discussion/review/prioritization
3. Plan: Once the team has the project approved, the planning can begin. The Issue Baord can be used to establish team for the project, project requirements, timelines, etc.
4. Code: Once everything an initial plan is developed, the codebase can be created
5. Commit: (iterative process) develop first draft or prototype of application/code for review, use version-control, and keep improving
6. Test: Use Gitlab CI, run scripts to build and test the application/code
7. Review: Once tests/builds pass, code review and approval can occur as a team
8. Staging: Deploy code to staging environment(s) to make sure everything is working properly (and users/proposer) is happy
9. Production: After staging and approval by testers/users, deploy to production environment
10. Feedback: Using Analytics, the team can review their work on projects; Also, users and team-members can submit bugs, feedback, comments via Issue Board

### Idea:

When submitting a proposal/idea, it should include at minimum:

1. Business case (why does WashU Libraries need this project implemented?)
2. Basic list of requirements/needs that will be fulfilled by project
3. Links to any relevant Github repositories or websites
4. Approval by AUL/Department Head

### Issue Tracker:

    - Discuss Ideas
    - Report Bugs or Problems
    - Submit Proposals
    - Getting help
    - Discussing Code Implementations
